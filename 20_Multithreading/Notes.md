## Threads
Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time.

Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting the main program.

## Creating a thread
There are two ways to create a thread.

ðŸ”¸It can be created by extending the **Thread class** and overriding its **run() method:**
    
    
    public class Main extends Thread {
        public void run() {
          System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
        }
    }

ðŸ”¸Another way to create a thread is to implement the **Runnable interface:**

    public class Main implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
          System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
        }
    }

## Running Threads
ðŸ”¸If the class extends the **Thread class**, the thread can be run by creating an instance of the class and call its start() method.

    public class Main extends Thread {

        public static void main(String[] args) {

          Main thread = new Main();
          thread.start();
          System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");

        }

ðŸ”¸If the class implements the Runnable interface, the thread can be run by passing an instance of the class to a Thread object's constructor and then calling the thread's start() method.

    public class Main implements Runnable {

        public static void main(String[] args) {

          Main obj = new Main();

          Thread thread = new Thread(obj);

          thread.start();
          System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
        }
